# IT Learning Platform Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and key components of the IT Learning Platform, including recent optimizations and security measures.

## Performance Optimizations

### Lazy Loading
- Shop components are lazy loaded using Next.js dynamic imports
- Course components use dynamic imports with loading states
- Components are split into smaller, more manageable chunks

### Redis Caching
- Module data is cached using Redis
- Cache TTL set to 24 hours
- Cache invalidation on module updates
- Caching functions:
  - `getCachedModule`: Retrieve single module
  - `setCachedModule`: Cache single module
  - `getCachedModules`: Retrieve all modules
  - `setCachedModules`: Cache all modules
  - `invalidateModuleCache`: Invalidate single module cache
  - `invalidateAllModulesCache`: Invalidate all modules cache

### Code Splitting
- Routes are code-split by default using Next.js App Router
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Suspense boundaries for loading states
- Optimized bundle sizes

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Role-based access control (USER, ADMIN, INSTRUCTOR)
- Protected API routes
- Session management

### API Security
- Rate limiting using Upstash Redis
- IP whitelisting
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Content Security Policy (CSP)

### Data Protection
- Encrypted connections (HTTPS)
- Secure password hashing
- Environment variable protection
- Database security best practices

## Component Architecture

### UI Components
- Modular design using shadcn/ui
- Reusable components:
  - Button
  - Card
  - Badge
  - Radio Group
  - Checkbox
  - Label

### Feature Components
- Shop
  - SubscriptionPlans
  - PaymentForm
  - ShopProducts
- Courses
  - CourseList
  - CourseFilters
  - CourseCard

### State Management
- React hooks for local state
- Server-side state management
- Redis for caching
- Prisma for database operations

## Database Schema
- User model with authentication fields
- Course and module relationships
- Subscription and payment tracking
- Activity and progress monitoring

## API Routes
- RESTful API design
- Protected routes with middleware
- Rate limiting and caching
- Error handling and logging

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for features
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Performance monitoring

## Deployment
- Vercel deployment
- Environment configuration
- Build optimization
- Performance monitoring

## Future Improvements
- GraphQL API implementation
- WebSocket for real-time features
- Enhanced caching strategies
- Additional security measures
- Performance optimizations
